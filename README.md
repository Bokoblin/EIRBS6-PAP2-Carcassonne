### Code conventions

- Put a space after a comma and between operators
- Put structures names, variables and functions in lower case with underscores to separate words
- Put functions/structures start bracket on the line after the prototype
    (small structures, getters, setters can be inline though)
- Put statements/loops start bracket on the same line separated by a space
- Don't add spaces between function name and the argument list in parenthesis
- You don't have to put brackets for one-line statements
- Put two lines between each function in headers
- Put one line between each function in implementation
- Use Javadoc style documentation
- Write `NOTE`, `TODO` or `FIXME` in uppercase in comments when you respectively need to notice, do or fix something
- Don't put spaces after an open parenthesis / before a close parenthesis
